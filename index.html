        <h1 style="background-color:purple;">About Me</h1>
        <p style="background-color:tomato;">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

    <h1 style="background-color:purple;">Work</h1>
       <p style="background-color:tomato;"> I started working due to necessity, but I think along the way luxury became my necessity. I feel that no matter how much I make, it was not enough because there is always something else I need to have. I believe it is about the lifestyle I chose to live which is influenced by the society we live in. I work hard now because it is for my children. I want to provide them with what I did not have growing up. I want to make sure that they have nothing to worry about except to finish school and get a good job. I did not have the same opportunity so I feel that it is very important for me to provide them with the education they need. Most jobs require a degree in order to move up in the company. All the work experience that I had did not get me what I wanted at my company because of politics and other reasons. This is the other reason why I am back in school. Education and experience are what most companies are seeking for anyone they hire.</p>
